  goal_title: 'My vision',
  goal: `My goal is to develop in the field of
    development, using modern technologies, creating
    optimal and effective architectural solutions.
    I want to work on projects that apply cutting-edge
    technologies, and in a team where I can develop
    my knowledge and help achieve high results.I believe
    that to achieve this, it’s
    important to constantly grow and maintain teamwork.
    It’s essential that everyone in the team can
    contribute and work toward common goals. I value

  my_experience_title: `My experience.`,
  my_experience: `I have experience working on two projects.
      The first one is a car rental service built with ASP.NET.
    My tasks included creating a database using Cosmos DB,
    writing business logic, handling dependency injections,
    and deploying the project on a free Azure subscription.
    I also wrote a Telegram bot in C# that worked alongside
    the main interface. The second project is a clone of
    the Notion website, built with ASP.NET API + React.
    I was fully responsible for the frontend, working with
    design mockups, receiving responses from APIs, and
    creating offline functionality using local storage.
    Additionally, I developed Telegram bots with AI integration
    to exchange data between the AI API and the client via the Telegram interface.`,


  cooperation_title: `Cooperation with me`,
  cooperation: `I can guarantee openness and sincerity on my part, 
    constructive communication within the team, and full dedication.
    Working with me is not only about creating a high-quality product,
    but also about sharing ideas, perspectives, and knowledge.`,
